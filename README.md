The first page is login page, you can enter your username and password or create a new user when you navigate to the sign up page. After logging in, you go to your group page, where you can see your groups, create a new one or check whether you have received an invitation. On the general post page you can write a post, search for specific posts (title and tags) and/or like, dislike and pin a post. On the right side after clicking on the profile icon, various options appears, including team cohesion, calendar, whiteboard room, and questions for team cohesion. There is also a reminder on the post page where you can give a time and then it will remind you when the time is up.

When writing a post it is important you manually refresh the the post page to see the post.

We have set up some premade users you can use that are already invited to and members of different groups. You can use theese if you dont feel like creating your own:

username: user1
